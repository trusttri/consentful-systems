                In this work, we use a theoretical framework of <strong>affirmative consent ("Yes means yes!")</strong> to understand such problematic phenomena and generate new design ideas to tackle them.

                <h2>1. Principles of affirmative consent </h2>
                Affirmative consent is the idea that <b>someone must ask for, and earn, enthusiastic approval before interacting with someone else</b>. For decades, feminist activists and scholars have used affirmative consent to theorize and prevent sexual assault.
                Here, we introduce the five principles of affirmative consent. If you are curious about the prior research that has informed these principles, please check our <a href="" style="color: white"><b>paper</b></a>!

                        Current content feeds do not ask what a user wants to see; they typically assume what a user wants based on inference over platform data. As a result, many encounter unwanted posts in their feeds, sometimes even <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172">after the user has invested great effort to avoid such posts</a>. A content feed constructed around the voluntary principle of affirmative consent would periodically ask what the user wants to see.
                        <br><br>
                        Imagine that Lucy logs onto a new platform called Socious, and the platform greets them by asking “What do you want to see this week?” Lucy sees Socious recommended keywords like “Flower Tending”, “Animation”, and “Dance” based on topic modeling. Lucy decides they would like to see more of flowers, dance, and animation. Lucy also notices they can specify topics they do not want to see. Lucy can also select among tags that include well-known triggering topics. Lucy selects “Self Harm”, “Alt Right,” and “Race” for exclusion from their feed. As Lucy scrolls down the feed, they see the new preferences immediately reflected. After a week, Socious asks Lucy again for topic preferences—though Lucy can change the frequency of requests any time.

                        Our social networks constantly change offline—we sometimes distance ourselves from people who were once close friends, go through break-ups, or our loved ones pass away. However, the rigidity of current platforms makes it hard to reflect these changes. For instance, Facebook’s feature called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1056848067697293/?helpref=hc_fnav">Memories</a> shows content that you shared in the past—in some cases showing memories that a person may not want to recall, such as photos of one’s recently deceased family.
                        <br><br>
                        Imagine Jon logged into WebCon, a new social platform. Jon recently went through a break-up, and wants to remove all data related to his ex-partner, Emily. Jon goes to the dashboard and queries for his posts that Emily liked, is tagged in, or left comments on, as well as Emily’s posts that he liked, is tagged in, or left comments on. He decides to delete all of his posts that are related to Emily. He also chooses to remove his likes, comments, and tags in/on Emily’s posts. Jon goes back to his profile page and sees these posts removed from his profile. Jon also deletes all of Emily’s comments in his remaining posts. In contrast, Jon cannot delete Emily’s posts of Jon, as those posts are Emily’s.

                    On most current platforms, when a person sets their account to public, strangers or spam accounts can DM them with unsolicited content. <a href="https://ncvc.dspacedirect.org/handle/20.500.11990/10">For instance, about half of American women ages 18 to 29 have received explicit images they never asked for.</a> At internet scale, it becomes very difficult to exercise control over messages; some people abandon platforms altogether for this reason.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine Sannvi has been receiving many unwanted messages on CoMedia. The messages often include compliments about her looks, which she finds uncomfortable. Sannvi decides she does not want to see such messages and goes to “Control Panel,” applying network-centric rules such as: Only allow people that my friends have messaged to message me. Now, if a stranger messages Sannvi on CoMedia, the system first looks up whether the sender has ever interacted with Sannvi or any of her friends on the platform. If not, CoMedia sends the stranger’s message to a separate queue which Sannvi can later review if she wants.
